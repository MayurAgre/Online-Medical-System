        <h1>Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel Hospital</h1>
        <div class="container">
            <p>Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel Hospital is located in thickly populated colony of Patel Nagar ( Part of West
            Delhi), surrounded by adjoining colonies of Baba Farid Puri, Rajasthan Colony, Prem Nagar, Baljeet Nagar,
            Ranjeet Nagar, Shadi Pur, Kathputli Colony, Regar Pura etc inhabited by large population of people belonging
            to Low and Middle Socio – economic status. About 7 – 8 lakhs of people fall in the catchment area of the
            Hospital and are dependent on this hospital for their day-to-day health needs.</p>
           <p> Earlier this was an MCW center with MCD, which was taken over from MCD by Govt of NCT of Delhi on 01 – 10 –
            1996 by a special act passed through assembly. The prime aim of the take over was to up grade this hospital
            to 50 bedded capacity so that it acts as a Secondary Level Health care delivery outlet in the area thus
            reducing workload on Tertiary level Hospitals like RML Hospital, Lady Harding Hospital, Kalawati Saran
            Hospital, LNJP Hospital, DDU Hospital etc so that the bigger Hospitals can work more efficiently. The
            50-bedded Hospital is fully functional at present providing round the clock facilities in different
            specialties (Mentioned later on). The Increasing attendance in OPD & Casualty, Increasing number of
            Laboratory Tests, X Rays & Ultrasound, more & more patients being operated upon and rising Bed Occupancy
            Rate is an indication of growing Popularity of the hospital in the area and sincere attempt of Govt of NCT
            of Delhi and staff of the Hospital in upgradation of the Hospital.</p>
